Another attempt at building a small 3d engine ( currently openGL).
This is a personal / learning project mainly to "play" with C++

### Inspiration

As it turns out, this will be heavily inspired by "The Cherno" engine : Hazel.
His Youtube "Game engine" playlist is wonderfull. I learn a lot, even if, frankly , I wouldn't be able to come up with such nice and complicated code. But then again, I am here to learn.
