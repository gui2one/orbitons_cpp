Another attempt at building a small 3d engine ( currently openGL).
This is a personal / learning project mainly to "play" with C++

### Inspiration

As it turns out, this will be heavily inspired by "The Cherno" engine : Hazel.
His Youtube "Game engine" playlist is wonderfull. I learn a lot, even if, frankly , I wouldn't be able to come up with such nice and complicated code. But then again, I am here to learn.

### Rendering

That the part that is merely a copy of TheCherno's engine. ( plus some others bugs I guess :) )

OpenGL only ( for now ). But I am excited to try and add Direct3D ... this will be a first for me.

### Targets

Windows only for now. Even if I defenitely want to add other targets ( Linux mainly).

### Build

Relies heavily on vcpkg.exe.
when cloning git repo, don't forget to use

    git clone url --recurse-submodules
